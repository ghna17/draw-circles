# draw-circles
Create a program that...
1. imports 3 Python modules including Turtle.
2. asks the user how many circles should be drawn.
3. uses a For Loop to draw that many circles in random locations.
4. draws each circle with a random radius of 10 to 50 units.
5. for each circle drawn, prints "The area of circle X is Y square units.", rounded to 2 places.
6. prints a special alert on the next to last loop.
 * Include a state diagram showing your program's state at the point the alert is printed.
7. prints the total area of all the circles at the end of the program, rounded to 2 places.
